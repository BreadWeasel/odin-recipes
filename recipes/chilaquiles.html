            <li>
                Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Fry tortillas and onion in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, stirring frequently. 
                Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. 
                Drain the skillet, leaving only a thin residue of oil. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the skillet over medium heat. Return fried tortillas and onion to the skillet and stir in beaten eggs; season with salt. 
                Cook and stir until eggs are firm. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in tomato sauce and water. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. 
                Sprinkle with cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted.
